### Landing AI and How it is Solving Problems in the Manufacturing Industry

# MSU EdX Ai BootCamp Module 1 Challenge by Aaron Wood



## Overview and Origin

Landing AI is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) company responding to the challenges businesses face in adopting AI with the goal of realizing practical value.  

As with any new tool, businesses face the challenge of answering ‘how do we’ questions.  However, the technical complexity of implementing an AI project along with the anticipated high return on investment makes answering these questions both daunting and difficult.
What should we tackle first?  Acquiring technical knowledge to assess what is, and is not, technically feasible is difficult. This is further exasperated given the complexity of the technology and current wide-spread misunderstanding about what AI is today, relative to the perceived end-state of AI.

Where’s the data and can we use it?  Acquiring large, high-quality datasets to train and operate, effectively, requires both an understanding of data sources and techniques to manipulate or condition data. It’s worth noting many companies already have troves of data in their data warehouses - being able to assess the value and use cases for the data is the mystery companies will need to solve.

What’s it going to cost?  The high cost of implementing bespoke AI solutions tends to push leaders to choose projects with large returns ($1M and up). This leads to joyful business outcomes like: layers of management oversight to control costs and ensure returns, missed deadlines, paralysis-by-analysis and ultimately, failed grand-plans.  Landing AI suggests businesses start small ($50 - $200k) and focus on growing their technical capabilites. 

Are we going to create ethical and regulatory problems?  Data privacy, compliance w/ AI law and regulations and bias in algorithms need to be assessed and managed to ensure AI soltuons are transparent, compliant and fair.

Is our culture, objectives and structure such that we can succeed with AI?  Integrating AI into established business processes requires, typically, significant changes to company culture, objectives and organizational construct.

Landing AI seeks to offer an AI platform to help developers more easily build and deploy AI solutions.  While the company is targeting the following industries: automotive, agriculture, electronics, food & beverage, medical devices, infrastructure, pharma, EV manufacturing, manufacturing and life sciences, the focus of this study is on their approach to bringing their AI solution methodology to the manufacturing sector.

In the manufacturing sector, the company is focused first on a product called LandingLens.  Andrew Ng said, in an interview with Joe Miller of protocol.com on May 18 2021:

> We ended up building LandingLens, which is a data-centric, MLOps platform for computer vision. We help companies — starting in manufacturing but we have interest in other computer vision vertical applications — be 10x more efficient and often much more successful as well in building and deploying computer vision systems.

## Business Activities

# What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Landing AI is solving the problem of scaling AI.

The company’s approach is to offer an AI platform (with ready-built tools) that enables customers to develop, deploy, track, and maintain their AI solutions.

LandingLens, the company’s flagship product uses cutting-edge AI technology to “enable computer vision applications to be built and deployed 10x faster than before, thereby creating significant ROI.  (https://landing.ai/careers/)

# Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Landing AI is focused on the manufacturing sector. Their target customers are manufacturers.

From a market or industry sector perspective, Landing AI is focused on sub-industries within the broader manufacturing industry which can benefit most from AI-powered machine vision systems.  The company lists these manufacturing sectors as their target industries on their website: automotive, electronics, food & beverage, medical devices, life sciences, agriculture, manufacturing, infrastructure, pharma, EV manufacturing.

According to the US National Institute for Standards and Technology, the manufacturing industry accounts for 12% of total US GDP (2021), equal to $2.3 trillion. The industry employs 14.7 million people.

# What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer?

According to the company’s website, Landing AI is pioneering the so-called Data-Centric AI movement in which “companies with limited data sets can realize the business value of AI and move AI projects from proof-of-concept to full-scale production.”  The company sees ‘data-centricity’ a key part of their overall value proposition.

A focus on using data along with deep learning, vs the traditional rules-based approach to determine an outcome produces systems which excel in subtle or nuanced inspection problems.  Ultimately, higher accuracy is realized. As an example, false-rejections decrease, improving business performance.

In general, this is not a novel approach to adding AI to machine vision systems, so it would be unrealistic to say the company’s data-centric approach is a unique competitive advantage.

Perhaps, the most important unique competitive advantage the company has is that Dr. Andrew Ng is a prominent figure in the AI field, posessing a strong track record.  Dr. Ng’s reputation and network connections should enable the company to establish strategic partnerships ahead of their competitors.  Collaborations with industry leaders in manufacturing can lead to proof points that can accelerate market share gain and decrease customer-acquisition costs.

# Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?

Landing AI is a realtively new private company using cutting-edge AI technology. And, the cutting-edge in the AI field is moving rapidly and in multiple directions.

Given that their flagship product, LandingLens, is an AI-powered machine vision system.  As such, it’s likely the company is leveraging, at least, the following AI technologies to power their solution.

Deep Learning: Deep neural networks are commonly used for image analysis and object recognition. They can learn to detect and classify objects, patterns, and features in images.

Machine Learning Algorithms: Machine learning models, such as support vector machines (SVMs) and decision trees, can be applied to various machine vision tasks, depending on the specific problem and dataset.

Image Processing: Image processing techniques like filtering, edge detection, and thresholding are often used to enhance and preprocess images before feeding them into the AI algorithms.

Object Detection: Object detection algorithms are used to identify and locate objects within images or video streams.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR): OCR technology is used to recognize and extract text from images, enabling the conversion of printed or handwritten text into machine-readable data.

Pattern Recognition: Pattern recognition algorithms are used to identify and categorize recurring patterns or motifs in images, which is valuable in quality control, industrial inspection, and document analysis.

## Results

# What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Landing AI was founded in 2017, just six years ago.  In February of this year, the company began offering to anyone LandingLens for free. In doing so, the company claims they are democratizing the creation of AI for companies large and small. 

Landing AI is a proponent and advocate of businesses using limited datasets that most companies already have.  This ‘data-centric’ approach means businesses can implement AI machine vision faster and at a lower cost.

The impact of the ‘start small’ and ‘data-centric’ approach should be much faster adoption of this particular AI technology, with others to follow.  Placing easy-to-get-up-and-running AI capabilities in the hands of more employees flattens the learning curve, enabling faster realization of practical value. In this way, Andrew Ng is achieving the original idea for Landing AI.

# What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success?

From an AI Machine Vision System perspective, accuracy is the most important metric.  Other metcis include precision, recall or sensitivity, false negative rate, and specificity.

# How is your company performing based on these metrics?

I can not say.

# How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

I can not say.



## Recommendations

# If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?

According to the World Robotics report, there was an all-time high of 517,385 new industrial robots installed in factories around the world, an increase of 31 % compared with 2020. This brings the stock of operational robots around the globe to a new record of about 3.5 million units. International Federation of Robotics, World Robotics Report, Dec 19, 2022.

Meanwhile, lack of skilled labor is a strong driver for automation across many industries, worldwide.

Combining these realities leads to the conclusion that Landing AI is in the leading position to leverage it’s capabilities to further advance their mission of making it easy for ROBOT companies large and small to adopt AI.

The next logical extension from AI machine vision in the manufacturing industry is AI machine vision for robots used to automate factories.
Therefore, Landing AI should offer, next, products and services for robotics, starting with robots that enable manufacturing automation.

# Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Landing AI would benefit from exploring the intersection of robotics, manufacturing automation and AI because doing so leverages their presumed success in the manufacturing sector with their data-centric approach to AI and their flagship product, LandingLens.

Landing AI has established a data-centric, AI-platform approach that make it possible to implement AI without a dedicated Machine Learning team.  

To at least some degree, the manufacturing industry has responded positively to the company’s offer, with more than 1,000 individuals signing up to use LandingLens before the company offered it for free to everyone in February 2023.  It stands to reason, the adoption rate of LandingLens with a $0 price should increase, further advancing Landing AI’s presence (and value) in the manufacturing industry.

The intersection of Process Automation, Manufacturing and Robotics is a synergistic one.  Advancements in one area often spur advancements in the others.  

According to the International Federation of Robotics' 2021 World Robot Report, industrial robotic installations have increased by 10 percent, and service robots' use has risen by 12 percent, leading to a nearly doubled global robotic density. Advanced vision systems are a key driver behind this growth, enabling highly automated and networked industrial processes. 

AI machine vision technology may allow robots to operate in real-time, eliminating the need for a physical definition of the product they interact with and enabling them to adapt to different tasks. Vision-enhanced robots offer greater versatility and improved interoperability in factory settings, aligning with the concept of Industry 4.0-connected factories.

# What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
